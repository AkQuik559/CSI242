        Participation: I had my camera turned on during Thursday's lecture. I was was driving home.
        Self Directed Learning: I am setting up an account with Codeccademy.
        Project: I went over the Personal Website rubric and will start working on the assignment.
        Extra Credit: We had the one on one. Talked about interships and what this class is about.
