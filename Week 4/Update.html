        Participation: This week I had my camera turned on during Tuesday lecture. I came in in person on thursday. 
        I asked about the codecademy and how we are supposed to show you we did it. I was in the 
        chat talking to Jonathan about the quirkyness of js. I had questions on thursdays lecture.
        Self Directed Learning: Learning the quirks in JS.

        Extra Credit: I'm not sure I don't know if I was credited this week or last week for helping
        students go online in github?
