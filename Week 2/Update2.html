        Passcodes: Tennis Ball & Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-rex). You guys weren't sure how to spell it and I left the meeting.
        Participation: This week I had my camera turned on during Tuesday & Thursday's lecture. 
        During week 2 Tuesday's class I asked about the passcode before Ryan did but you did not see my message in the chat.
        I also had another question that Jonathan answered and then we had a back and forth conversation.
        Self Directed Learning: I started the Codeccademy js class and completed the Introduction to Javascript.
        I'm Learing Logical Operators now. I will be done with all of Conditionals by tomorrow tonight.
        Project: I am going to work on this project tonight. I feel nervous because it has been a long time since our first HTML class.
        Extra Credit: I did not attempt this weeks extra credit.
